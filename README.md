# E-commerce Business Analysis: Dr.PONG Website Enhancement

This repository contains the business analysis and strategic proposal for enhancing the Dr.PONG e-commerce platform. This was submitted as a group project for the **ITDS294: Fundamentals of Electronic Commerce System** course at the Faculty of ICT, Mahidol University.

The core of this project is a business plan that analyzes the opportunity for Dr.PONG to transition from a marketplace-dependent model to a robust Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) channel by upgrading its official website.

## 1. Project Overview

Dr.PONG is a successful brand that primarily sells its beauty and supplementary products through third-party marketplaces like Shopee. While effective, this model presents significant challenges.

This project proposes the development of a fully functional e-commerce website on the official `drpong.store` domain. The key differentiator is the introduction of a **"Skin Function"**—a new feature designed to analyze a user's skin and recommend the most suitable products, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and sales.

## 2. The Problem

Our analysis identified three core issues with the current marketplace-centric strategy:

* **High Commission Fees:** Selling as a "Mall seller" on Shopee incurs substantial fees (e.g., 10.70% in the beauty category), which impacts profitability.
* **Brand & Counterfeit Risk:** The brand has less control over its image and faces risks from counterfeit products on these platforms.
* **Customer Mismatch:** A significant customer pain point, identified from Shopee reviews, is purchasing products that are not suitable for their specific skin type or color without being able to trial them first.

## 3. The Solution

We propose enhancing the official Dr.PONG website with two primary components:

1.  **Full E-commerce Capability:** Transform the existing website into a complete D2C platform where users can browse, purchase, and pay for products directly.
2.  **"Skin Function" Recommendation Engine:** A new, value-add feature that provides personalized product recommendations.
    * Users input data such as age, gender, allergies, and sleep habits.
    * Logged-in users can also upload a photo of their skin for a more precise analysis.
    * The system then suggests a curated list of Dr.PONG products tailored to their specific needs.

This solution aims to solve the identified problems by reducing marketplace fees, controlling the brand experience, and directly addressing the customer's need for personalized guidance.
