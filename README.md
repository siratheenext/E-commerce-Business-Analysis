# E-commerce Business Analysis: Dr.PONG Website Enhancement

This repository contains the business analysis and strategic proposal for enhancing the Dr.PONG e-commerce platform. This was submitted as a group project for the **ITDS294: Fundamentals of Electronic Commerce System** course at the Faculty of ICT, Mahidol University[cite: 1, 24, 25, 26, 29].

The core of this project is a business plan that analyzes the opportunity for Dr.PONG to transition from a marketplace-dependent model to a robust Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) channel by upgrading its official website.

---

## 1. Project Overview

[cite_start]Dr.PONG is a successful brand that primarily sells its beauty and supplementary products through third-party marketplaces like Shopee[cite: 40, 50]. While effective, this model presents significant challenges.

[cite_start]This project proposes the development of a fully functional e-commerce website on the official `drpong.store` domain[cite: 51]. [cite_start]The key differentiator is the introduction of a **"Skin Function"**—a new feature designed to analyze a user's skin and recommend the most suitable products, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and sales[cite: 51, 389].

## 2. The Problem

Our analysis identified three core issues with the current marketplace-centric strategy:

* [cite_start]**High Commission Fees:** Selling as a "Mall seller" on Shopee incurs substantial fees (e.g., 10.70% in the beauty category), which impacts profitability[cite: 50].
* [cite_start]**Brand & Counterfeit Risk:** The brand has less control over its image and faces risks from counterfeit products on these platforms[cite: 50, 53].
* [cite_start]**Customer Mismatch:** A significant customer pain point, identified from Shopee reviews, is purchasing products that are not suitable for their specific skin type or color without being able to trial them first[cite: 50, 61].

## 3. The Solution

We propose enhancing the official Dr.PONG website with two primary components:

1.  [cite_start]**Full E-commerce Capability:** Transform the existing website into a complete D2C platform where users can browse, purchase, and pay for products directly[cite: 51].
2.  [cite_start]**"Skin Function" Recommendation Engine:** A new, value-add feature that provides personalized product recommendations[cite: 51, 389].
    * [cite_start]Users input data such as age, gender, allergies, and sleep habits[cite: 390].
    * [cite_start]Logged-in users can also upload a photo of their skin for a more precise analysis[cite: 390, 396].
    * [cite_start]The system then suggests a curated list of Dr.PONG products tailored to their specific needs[cite: 431].

[cite_start]This solution aims to solve the identified problems by reducing marketplace fees, controlling the brand experience, and directly addressing the customer's need for personalized guidance[cite: 53, 54].
